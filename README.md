# Dotfiles

## What is this

My development set up is fully on commandline, with combination of many tools. This project have all the configuration for the tools that I have written and improved over years. As I am working between multiple machines, I wanted to centralize all my configurations and this is the product.

## How to set up

The setup of dotfiles is done using the `init.sh` script.

```sh
    $ cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/adikari/dotfiles.git
    $ cd dotfiles
    $ ./init.sh
```

Thats all we need to do. The script will set up everything and prepare the environment.

The dotfiles will set up:

1. [Powerline]
2. [Vim]
3. [Git config]
4. [Tmux]


I am at the moment working on detailed documentation on each features that will be added by installing this project.
